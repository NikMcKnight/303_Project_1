Project Goal Order:

	Sprint 1:
		Evaluate an expression with operators that rely on two numbers and return a single value
		e.g.
			2 + 5
			8 / 2
		Assumptions:
			Must have spaces between each number and operator to work correctly atm
			
	Sprint 2:
		???
			

Sprint 1 pseudo code

	2 + 5
	1)
		operand_stack: 2
	2)
		operator found, +
		top element on stack is lhs
		next element in string is rhs
		combine and place on stack
	3)
		no more element result is on stack
